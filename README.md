this is a grow a garden script that i made, i decided to upload it since i had a really hard time figuring out how people collect crops fast, if you wonder how the buffer.fromstring works reach out to me on discord @dandush
if you just want to use the script without looking at the source you can just run the following:
```
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dandushlol/grow-a-garden/refs/heads/main/GrowAGarden/Better.lua")()
```
